        From time to time Sapien may launch Contests linked to the Sapien
        Platform; such as Referral Contests, Contests with other service
        providers, and/or other programs, which may reward users who sign-up and
        participate in the contest and follow the contest terms and conditions,
        among others. Participants in these contests are required to follow the
        terms and conditions of the contest to be eligible for any prizes.{' '}
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Prizes: Sapien may include prizes of its utility token SPN or other
        tokens such as ETH as part of a particular contest. These prizes may be
        reflected in USD equivalents solely for ease of comparison purposes, and
        the USD equivalent amount is to be viewed as approximate as the actual
        prize in SPN or other tokens may vary from the stated USD equivalent.

      <p>
        Contest Monitoring: Sapien will be performing continual monitoring of

        fair and transparent Contest. Paying individuals to participate in the
        referral contest, using any currency or other monetary incentive,
        including posting bounties or hiring virtual assistants or click farms,
        is strictly forbidden and will result in immediate disqualification. In
        the event that any fraudulent or manipulative activity is suspected,
        Sapien reserves the right to take appropriate action which may include
        the removal of a Contest participant, closure of a userâ€™s Sapien
        platform account, redefining of Contest terms, and/or suspension of the
        Contest among others. Any action involving a change regarding the
        overall Contest will be communicated in a timely manner.

        <strong className="font-extrabold">13. Arbitration</strong>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        13.1 Agreement to Arbitrate. This Section 13 is referred to herein as
        the “Arbitration Agreement.” The parties agree that any and all
        controversies, claims, or disputes between you and Company arising out
        of, relating to, or resulting from this Agreement, shall be subject to
        binding arbitration pursuant to the terms and conditions of this
        Arbitration Agreement, and not any court action (other than a small
        claims court action to the extent the claim qualifies). The Federal
        Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this
        Arbitration Agreement.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        13.2 Class Action Waiver. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING
        CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A
        PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE
        ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH PARTIES AGREE OTHERWISE, THE
        ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S
        CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED,
        REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD
        RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN
        FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT
        NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL
        CLAIM(S).
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        13.3 Procedures. Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator
        in accordance with the American Arbitration Association's ("AAA") rules
        and procedures (the "AAA Rules"), as modified by this Arbitration
        Agreement. If there is any inconsistency between the AAA Rules and this
        Arbitration Agreement, the terms of this Arbitration Agreement will
        control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the
        inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a
        fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the
        provisions of this Agreement as a court would, including without
        limitation, the limitation of liability provisions in Section 12. You
        may visit https://www.adr.org for information on the AAA and
        https://www.adr.org/fileacase for information on how to file a claim
        against the Company.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        13.4 Venue. The arbitration shall be held in the county in which you
        reside or at another mutually agreed location. If the value of the
        relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or the Company may elect to have
        the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written
        submissions, which election shall be binding on each party, but subject
        to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing if the
        circumstances warrant. Attendance at any in-person hearing may be made
        by telephone by either or both parties unless the arbitrator requires
        otherwise.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        13.5 Governing Law. The arbitrator will decide the substance of all
        claims in accordance with the laws of the state of California, without
        regard to its conflicts of laws rules, and will honor all claims of
        privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by
        rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users of the Site, but
        is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving you to the extent
        required by applicable law.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        13.6 Costs of Arbitration. Payment of all filing, administration, and
        arbitrator fees (collectively, the "Arbitration Fees") will be governed
        by the AAA's Rules. Each party will be responsible for all other fees it
        incurs in connection with the arbitration, including without limitation,
        all attorney fees.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        13.7 Confidentiality. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any
        ruling, decision or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly
        confidential for the benefit of all parties.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        13.8 Severability. If a court decides that any term or provision of this
        Arbitration Agreement other than Section 13.2 is invalid or
        unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with
        a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest
        to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or
        provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so
        modified. If a court decides that any of the provisions of Section 13.2
        is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration
        Agreement shall be null and void. The remainder of this Agreement will
        continue to apply.

      <p>
        YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR

        AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS
        PERMANENTLY BARRED.

      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
        laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any principles
        of conflicts of law. You agree that any action at law or in equity
        arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Site that is not
        subject to arbitration under Section 13 shall be filed only in the state
        or federal courts in California and you hereby consent and submit to the
        personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any
        such action. The failure of any party at any time to require performance
        of any provision of this Agreement shall in no manner affect such
        party’s right at a later time to enforce the same. A waiver of any
        breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a
        continuing waiver of other breaches of the same or other provisions of
        this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement shall be unlawful,
        void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be
        deemed severable from this Agreement and shall not affect the validity
        and enforceability of any remaining provisions. This Agreement, and any
        rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or
        assigned by you, but may be assigned by the Company without restriction.
        This is the entire agreement between us relating to the subject matter
        herein and shall not be modified except in writing, signed by both
        parties, or by a change to this Agreement made by the Company as set
        forth herein.

          19. Sapien Passport Purchase Terms and Conditions
        </strong>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Following are the general terms and conditions for the Sapien NFT
        Passport Purchase:
      </p>
      <p>
        To complete the Sapien NFT Passport Purchase, Sapien relies on outside
        service providers such as Metamask, Google APIs, and AWS among others.
        Sapien has no affiliation with these service providers and maintains no
        liability for any issues, errors, or other problems encountered with the
        use of these service providers.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        Sapien also relies on internal technology to complete the Sapien NFT
        Passport Purchase, and has made reasonable efforts to ensure that the
        technology and processes have passed industry standard quality control
        checks, and cybersecurity controls have also been established. Sapien
        maintains no liability for any issues, errors, or other problems
        encountered with the technology or any processes required during the
        Sapien NFT Passport Purchase.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        The Sapien NFT Passport Purchase process flow relies heavily on the
        accuracy of the email address submitted during the registration process
        and associated service provider. At any point in time during the
        process, issues may occur with the email address, and email address
        provider among others. Sapien maintains no liability for any issues
        pertaining to email addresses, and email address providers among others
        during the Sapien NFT Passport Purchase process including registration
        to final confirmation.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        The Sapien NFT Passport Purchase is limited to one Sapien NFT Passport
        per unique passport purchase code that has been received by means of an
        email address submitted during the registration process. Sapien
        maintains no liability for issues pertaining to an incorrect email
        address submitted during registration.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        The purchase of a Sapien NFT Passport provides the purchaser with the
        opportunity to select a historical figure that has not already been
        selected by another passport holder, and then the opportunity to select
        a picture of that historical figure, provided by Sapien, which has not
        been copyrighted and from which a stylized version of that historical
        figure will be generated. The Sapien NFT Passport purchaser also may
        upload their own picture of their historical figure selection; however,
        Sapien will need to check copyright ownership prior to the use of the
        uploaded picture. If the picture is copyrighted, then it cannot be used
        and the purchaser will be required to upload another picture, or select
        from one that Sapien provides. In addition, although a historical figure
        has been selected, and a picture has been selected and stylized, the
        historical figure has still not yet been fully approved by Sapien and
        the purchaser is not guaranteed their historical figure selection and
        may have to select another historical figure for Sapien to approve. The
        final approval by Sapien occurs after the Sapien NFT Passport purchase
        and after the historical figure selection. Sapien maintains the right to
        reject, without cause, any historical figure selection.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        In terms of the historical figure selection, there are to be no
        duplicate historical figures, each historical figure selection provides
        the Sapien NFT Passport holder with a unique avatar of their historical
        figure selection, pending approval by Sapien, and no other Sapien NFT
        Passports will have that historical figure.{' '}
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        The purchase of a Sapien NFT Passport will provide the purchaser with
        early access to the Sapien Nation Tribe Protocol to experiment with
        launching their own DAO. Sapien maintains no liability in regards to any
        and all issues arising from any and all member DAOs.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        At this time, Sapien NFT Passport purchasers have limited usage on the
        developing Sapien Nation platform. Sapien has planned to allow Sapien
        NFT Passport holders the ability to sign their passports at which point
        the Sapien NFT Passport becomes non-transferrable and identifies the
        purchaser publicly as a Founding Member. Several Utilities that are
        still in the planning and development stages by Sapien, and may be
        granted are to include, but are not guaranteed, among others:
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul className="list-decimal grid gap-6 mb-4 px-6">
        <li className="font-extrabold">
          Founding Members may consider launching their own social currencies
          and may receive UBI from the Sapien Nation to invest in communities
          that matter to them.
        </li>
        <li className="font-extrabold">
          Sapien NFT Passports create a form of decentralized digital identity,
          and are planned to utilize zero-knowledge proofs to protect personal
          information and share only what is required with others.
        </li>
        <li className="font-extrabold">
          The Passport is also planned to record achievements, contributions,
          and other interactions with other DAOs in the Sapien Nation.
        </li>
        <li className="font-extrabold">
          Founders may eventually be able to use the NFT passport to manage
          roles and permissions on the Sapien Tribe Protocol and may utilize the
          passport to access community events, merchandise, and other gated
          perks.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        There have been several blogs, emails, and other media posts by Sapien
        regarding the Sapien NFT Passport Purchase that contain forward looking
        statements and statements regarding the uniqueness of the Sapien Nation.
        Sapien does not guarantee the accuracy of this information or any
        results and further assumes no liability in connection with any media
        document, post, and email among others (collectively “documents”). In
        addition, Sapien does not guarantee the timeliness or completeness of
        the information contained within these documents and the information
        contained in these documents is subject to change without notice.
        Although forward looking statements contained in these documents may
        signal future direction at this time, they are subject to revision and
        Sapien does not undertake any obligation to publicly release the result
        of any revisions to these forward looking statements. In addition, while
        Sapien has made the claim of being the first nation in the metaverse in
        good faith, Sapien has not conducted overly extensive research to
        determine if Sapien is indeed the first nation on the metaverse and
        maintains no liability in terms of the accuracy of these statements.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        Sapien maintains a utility value in association with the Sapien NFT
        Passports in that their usage and other associated utilities will only
        be able to occur on the Sapien Nation platform. There are no planned
        usage functionalities outside of the Sapien Nation platform in regards
        to the Sapien NFT Passports.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        Proceeds from the sale of the Sapien NFT Passports are to be used solely
        to support the development of the Sapien Nation platform and not for any
        other purpose.
